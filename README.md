Android App that turns phone into drumstick and surroundings into drumset

In short, first the app detects the rotation vector (when you turn the phone while it is parallel to the ground).  Through the rotation position, the app determines which drum/ instrument to play (but does not play it automatically)

Then comes the linear acceleration sensor, and senses if there is a "hit" on a drum, and plays the drum/ instrument that was determined by the rotation vector sensor.

Looking to fine tune and tweak the functionality and aesthetics of this app a bit before publishing on the
Google Play Store.

Future releases will probably include the ability to switch to different percussion instruments, change the acceleration settings..
